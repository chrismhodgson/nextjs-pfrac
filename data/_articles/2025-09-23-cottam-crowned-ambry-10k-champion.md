summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Richard Cottam stormed to victory at the Ambry 10K, leading home a strong club contingent in 36-21. Clubmate James Mumford also made the podium with a fine run for third place in 38-16, doing especially well to recover after slipping at the start on the wet underfoot conditions. There was excellent strength in depth, with Ian Neville (15th, 42-23), Ian McNulty (47th, 52-36), Chloe Hinchliffe (48th, 54-03), Lisa Hinchliffe (62nd, 58-59) and Carl Matthewman (74th, 63-30) all flying the flag for Penistone.

At the Tissington Half Marathon, a breathtaking race along the old disused railway line through the Derbyshire Dales, Robert Lees impressed with a superb fifth place in 1-24-24, also taking first place in the men’s over45 category. Further afield, Peter Beever took part in the ABP Humber Coastal Half Marathon at Cleethorpes, completing the flat seafront course in 1-51-42 (chip time) to place 20th in the men’s over50 category. Also braving atrocious conditions in the Peak District, Dan Rushforth completed the gruelling High Peak 40, a 40-mile ultra with over 5,500 feet of ascent. Battling heavy rain and difficult terrain, he recorded a time of 7-35 on Strava, with official results still to be published.

There was also plenty to celebrate at [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-09-20), where James Fryers claimed outright victory at Thorp Perrow in 18-05. Julia Johnson starred at Dewsbury, finishing as second female in 23-12, her 84.84% age grading making her the club’s run of the weekend and topping the week’s club rankings. She was followed by Ian Neville (79.77%), Jill Scrivens (75.87%), Damian Kilpin (73.19%) and Bill Phillips (73.07%) in the top five runs of the week. Jill Scrivens (23-33, third female at Wilmslow) and Jon Hallam (20-43, third overall at Bowling Park) also impressed on the podium. Other highlights included Ian Neville (20-06, first V60 at Barnsley), Lisa Hinchliffe (27-14, first V50 at Pontefract), Keith Gordon (27-13, first V75 at Cannon Hall), and PBs for Dan Cooper (24-09 at Thornes), Michael Nicholson (23-09 at Dewsbury), Damian Kilpin (19-50 at Millfield), John Broom (23-17 at Baysgarth Park) and Angela Rollinson (34-18 at Barnsley).
