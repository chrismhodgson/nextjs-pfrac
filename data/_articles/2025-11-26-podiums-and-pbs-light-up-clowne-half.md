The club was out in force across road, fell and parkrun events, with standout results at the Clowne Half Marathon[](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2025/clowne-half-marathon) and strong performances in Race 5 of the Philip Senior Winter Handicap. At [Clowne](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2025/clowne-half-marathon), James Mumford led the club home in 1-20-56, while Suzanne McGill produced another excellent run to finish first in the ladies over45 category. There were further age-group podiums for Ian Neville, who placed second in the men’s over60, and Robert Davies, who took third in the same category, with Jade Crosby third senior woman and Jill Scrivens third in the ladies over55. The race also brought major personal breakthroughs for several runners, including a huge improvement from Amelia Cottam, who cut around fifteen minutes from her previous best with 1-58, and further PB progress from Chris Baldwin and Rory O’Sullivan. Rachael Mayston also managed to achieve a [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) in the ladies over55 category in 1-34-55.
