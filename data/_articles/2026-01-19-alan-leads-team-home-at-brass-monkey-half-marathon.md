Five Penistone runners took to the outskirts of York to compete in the popular Brass Monkey Half Marathon - an event that often attracts some of the country's elite runners. Alan Nutton broke the 80-minute barrier and led Penistone home in a chip time of 1:19:05 to finish 192nd overall, whilst first lady back for the club was Jade Crosby in a fantastic time of 1:27:44 to finish as 46th lady. Also competing were Gareth Irvine (1:28:01), Gemma Nutton (1:50:14) and Amelia Cottam (1:56:58), with Irvine having completed the Valencia Marathon just over one month prior.

George Parr and Phil Hinchliffe represented the club on the fells, travelling north to Penistone Hill Country Park near Haworth to participate in the [Stanbury Splash](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/stanbury-splash) fell race, covering more than six miles with 1200ft of ascent. George crossed the line in 16th position with a time of 55:30, with Phil taking 42nd spot in 62:47.

At the weekend's [Parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2026/2026-01-17) events, there was a first place for James Fryers at Lochend Woods, second gender places for Julia Johnson at Broadwater, Richard Heppenstall at Penistone and Flynn Rogers at Hillsborough and a third gender place for Emily Duckett at Penistone. Barbara Haigh topped the age-graded rankings for the club with 83.66%.
