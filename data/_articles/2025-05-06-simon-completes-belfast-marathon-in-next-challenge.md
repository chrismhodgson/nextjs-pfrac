summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
One week on from completing the Three Peaks Fell Race and the London Marathon, one day after the next, Simon Pike took on the next challenge in his fundraising efforts for Breast Cancer Now, travelling to Northern Ireland to complete the Belfast Marathon. Simon got round in 3:25:14, placing him in 708th position, a great time considering his efforts a week earlier.

Closer to home, six runners took part in the RunGreno Trail Race, a 7.3 mike route based in Grenoside.  First home for the club was Richard Cottam in third with a time of 46:18. Jemma Williams was first Penistone lady to cross the finish line, finishing 56th overall in 59:07, quick enough to claim first in the ladies v40 category.

Worsbrough was the venue for the third South Yorkshire Road League meet of 2025, a hilly course looping up to Birdwell before dropping back down.  James Mumford was first back for the club in 14th position with a time of 29:36. Suzanne McGill was first Penistone lady to cross the finish line, coming home in 75th in 33:37, just a few days after completing the London Marathon.

On the fells, Harriet Drouin and Joanne Boreham travelled to Saddleworth to compete in the 10-mile [Cake Race](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/the-cake-race), finishing in 1:48:58 and 1:53:30 respectively.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-05-03) scene, George Parr and Suzanne McGill took first gender places at Penistone. Dawn Broom was second female at South Woodham Ferrers, Hannah Shaw was third female at Penistone and Ashley Firth was third at North Yorkshire Water Park. Topping the age-graded charts were Dawn Broom with 83.62%, Suzanne McGill with 80.43%, Ian Neville with 77.81%, Flynn Rogers with 77.46% and Sue Hall with 73.90%. Ruth Albaya Melhuish did her 300th parkrun at Beverley and Lucy Clough did her 50th at Hull.
