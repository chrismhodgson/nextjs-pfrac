---
It was a proud week for the club as two members earned international honours. Graihagh Turner has been selected to represent England at the Under 18 Mountain Running Cup, taking place in Slovakia on 13th and 14th  June.  Graihagh joins an elite team of eight athletes competing against Europe’s best in the mountainous terrain—a superb achievement that reflects her dedication. Also flying the flag, Dawn Broom will don the England vest once again next weekend at the England vs Wales International Half Marathon. This will mark Dawn’s sixth appearance for the England Masters, but her first over the half marathon distance.

Simon Pike completed the latest challenge in his [fundraising efforts](https://www.justgiving.com/page/oliver-pike-15madchallenges) by finishing the Edinburgh Marathon in 3-41-58.  James Mumford placed fifth overall and first over40 man at the Northowrun 5 Mile race, clocking 29-42 on a hilly, windswept course.
