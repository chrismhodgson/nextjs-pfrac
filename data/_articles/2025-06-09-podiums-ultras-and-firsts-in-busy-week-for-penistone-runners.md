Ten runners took on the [Billy Bland Challenge](https://pfrac.co.uk/about/fell-and-trail-running) which involves a team of five pairs running the five legs of the Lake District Bob Graham challenge as a relay.  It’s 66 miles long and involves running over 42 of the Lake District’s summits.  Leg 1 runners were Jon Hallam and Dan Rushforth, leg 2 runners were Steve Sanders, Mark Crossley and Shaun Swallow, leg 3 runners were Tom Fryers and James Fryers, leg 4 runners were George Parr and Richard Cottam, leg 5 runners were Damian Kilpin and Suzanne McGill.  Supporters Liz Hutchison and Paul Fryers took care of logistics, refuelling and rehydration for the runners. The attempt started out at 1am and the rain soon came, this stayed with the team on and off through the day with each set of runners having their share. The rain did make conditions very slippery in places which makes the overall time for completion even better.  The team were very happy to complete in the challenge in a time of 20 hours and 10 minutes.

Nichola McNally took first over50 lady and fourth lady overall at the Marsden 10 mile trail race, clubmate Lesley Parker was fourth over50 lady.  Jemma Williams took on and completed the Cateran Yomp which is a 56 mile 24 hour event for the Army Benevolent Fund.  She completed the challenge in an impressive 20 hours and 13 minutes.  Also going long distances were Jill Carlton and Rachael Mayston, who completed the 37 mile Shepherd’s Ultra in Northumberland, finishing in 6th and 7th place.

Four runners took on the Kimmy Kanter race which is part of the KMR series.  They were Jill Scrivens, Mandy Mallinder, Keith Gordon and Gemma Nutton.  Josie Smith successfully completed her first ever marathon at the challenging Coniston Lakeland Trails event. Some of the club’s members took part in the Jack and Paul’s Fun Run. Flynn Rogers in particular had a good race.
