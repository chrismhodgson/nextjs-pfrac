The headline performance came at the Dewsbury 10K, where Jade Crosby produced a superb run to break the Penistone Footpath Runners female senior [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/), clocking 39-18 and dipping under forty minutes for the first time. Junior Flynn Rogers continued his excellent form with a personal best 34-09 to finish third in the under18 category, while Richard Heppenstall ran 35-00 to place fourth in the men’s over50s. Suzanne McGill also featured prominently, finishing fifth in the ladies over45 category in 40-46. Strong support came throughout the field, with Alan Nutton (35-15), Sean Pitt (35-33), Robert Lees (39-04), Alex Crosby (41-54), Michael Nicholson (45-32), Chris Baldwin (46-54), Sarah Bradley (50-24) and Stefan Butler-Gillen (57-22) all completing solid runs on the fast course. Heather Simpson closed the race particularly well, recording a personal best for the second 5K on her way to a 45-37 finish.

There was further success on the roads at the Alsager 5, where Nichola McNally produced an outstanding run to clock 33-48, finishing second in the ladies over55 category.  This also represented a new [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/).

On the fells, Damian Kilpin represented Penistone at the Cod Beck Canter Fell Race, a classic North Yorkshire winter event known for its steep climbs and rough terrain, continuing his consistent form on the fell circuit. A strong and evenly spread Penistone contingent also tackled the demanding [Mickleden Straddle](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/mickleden-straddle) Fell Race, a long winter outing in the Peak District.
