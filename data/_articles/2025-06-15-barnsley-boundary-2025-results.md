The Barnsley Boundary Race took place on Saturday 14 June.  34 teams took part, raising a total of Â£1870 for the [Barnsley Rockley Rotary Club](http://barnsleyrockleyrotary.org.uk/).  Three teams did not finish, due to missing runners and runners taken ill during the race.  Several runners stopped to help the runners taken ill, which led to the times for legs 4 and 7 being excluded from the overall race times.  The first three teams were Denby Dale Men's team, Penistone Men V50 and Barnsley AC Ladies.  [Full results](https://pfrac.co.uk/static/results/barnsley-boundary/bb-2025-results.pdf) are available on the race page.  Thank you to all the runners, marshalls provided by the Rotary Club, and especially the runners from Denby Dale AC, Kingstone Runners, Royston Rascals RC and Ackworth Road Runners, who stopped to help the runners taken ill.
