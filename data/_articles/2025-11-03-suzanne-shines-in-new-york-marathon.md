Suzanne McGill had a standout performance at the New York City Marathon, finishing in 3-13-49 to place in the top 6% of her age category at one of the world’s premier road races.

In Lincolnshire, Olivia Clough continued her good autumn form with 57-22 at the Brigg Poppy 10K. Further north, Dawn Godley tackled the Oldham Halloween Half Marathon, finishing in 2-04 and taking second in the ladies over55 category on a course described by organisers as “a gruelling challenge pushing runners to their limits.”

Closer to home, eight Penistone athletes took part in the Kimberworth Striders Canal Race, a five-mile out-and-back route along the Sheffield and Tinsley Canal. Ian Neville led the team home to win the men’s over60 prize, followed by Rory O’Sullivan, Mandy Mallinder, Keith Gordon, Stu Smith, John Howsham, Steve Dommett and Ray Brown.

Full results have now been released from the previous weekend’s South Yorkshire Cross Country League fixture at Longley Park, where Penistone turned out in strength. Oliver France led the Penistone senior men home in 44-07, ahead of Ian Neville (45-12), Matthew Robinson (45-53), Lee Storey (46-51), Daniel Limb (47-26), Oliver Pike (49-40), Andrew Sherbourne (50-00) and Mark Law (51-07), all producing strong runs on the challenging course. Flynn Rodgers placed sixth in the under-17 men’s race, while Martyn Goodwin (34-34), Steve Storey (35-50), Keith Gordon (40-04) and Nick Whittingham (44-54) all featured prominently in the veteran standings. Nichola McNally led the senior women’s squad home in 30-33, taking first place in the ladies over55 category, ahead of Fay Nicholls (33-47), Lesley Parker (34-37), Rebecca Timms (35-00), Jill Scrivens (35-19) and Heather Lindley (41-42).
