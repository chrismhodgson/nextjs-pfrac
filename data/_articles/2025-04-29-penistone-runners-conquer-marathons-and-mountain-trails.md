---
On a weekend when many runners were tackling the Spring Marathons, Penistone runner Tom Fryers took on and won the [Bleaklow Blitz](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/bleaklow-blitz) fell race in the Derbyshire peaks. It’s a tough race and consists of one of the longest continual climbs in the Peak District. Steve Storey also took part, finishing in 20th place. Graihagh Turner also came first at the [Duddon Dash](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/duddon-dash), part of the Junior English Fell Running Championships.

On the marathon front Penistone was well represented at the London and Manchester marathons. In very hot conditions, first back for the club was Suzanne McGill whose attempt to get under 3 hours again was scuppered by a fall at 15 miles. Nonetheless she still recorded an excellent time of 3-03-46. First man back was Andrew Pearson in 3-08-02, a new [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) for the vet 60 category.

Simon Pike continued his fundraising challenge by completing the Yorkshire [Three Peaks](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/70th-three-peaks) fell race on Saturday, followed by completing the London Marathon the following day. An amazing achievement given the distances involved and the logistical challenges. Chris Hodgson and Martyn Goodwin also completed the 24-mile Three Peaks fell race which takes in the summits of Penyghent, Whernside and Ingleborough.

At the Manchester Marathon, Andrew Heppenstall had an excellent run to finish in a time of 2-44-45. He was followed by Rob Davies who dipped under 3-20 with a time of 3-19-14.
