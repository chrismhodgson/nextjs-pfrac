Sunday saw the [Norman Cole Penistone 10K](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/penistone-10k) take place, a popular fixture on the local running calendar. The race follows a fast, scenic course on roads and the Trans-Pennine Trail and has, since 2022, been named in honour of club stalwart Norman Cole. Penistone Footpath Runners turned out in force once again, with 38 athletes taking part and delivering a string of strong performances, including an overall win and ten age-category podium finishes.  Suzanne McGill led the women’s team in style, finishing as first female overall and first in the ladies over45 age category in 42-17. Jade Crosby also topped her category, coming in as first senior lady in 44-17.  In the men’s field, Andrew Heppenstall took third overall and first over40 man (36-27), with Robert Lees also securing a category win as first over45 man (41-18). Michael Nicholson claimed first over50 man (47-02), and Jon Bentley added a second over55 man placing (41-34). Ashley Firth rounded out the senior men’s podium with third senior man in 38-41.  There were also third-place age-category finishes for Ian Neville (over60 man, 44-38), Nick Pepper (over50 man, 48-16), Loida Lopez (over50 ladies, 50-25), and Alan Knox (over70 man, 53-49), making it a notably successful morning for the club on home ground.

Wednesday evening saw club members take on the Tom Holmes Gala Chase, part of the Oughtibridge Sports Night. The event, named in memory of Tom Holmes, a pillar of the local community—features a steep 6km course for seniors and a shorter 3km route for juniors, both run through Wharncliffe Woods.  There was a clear win in the junior race for Penistone’s Flynn Rogers, who stormed home in 13-28, over two minutes ahead of his nearest rival.
