The club enjoyed an outstanding day at the [Meltham ‘Tough’ 10k](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2025/meltham-10k), one of West Yorkshire’s most demanding winter road races, with both the men’s and ladies’ teams taking first place under the three-to-count format. Individually, Flynn Rogers led the club home with a fine fourth place overall in 36-49, followed closely by Richard Heppenstall, who finished eighth overall in 37-56. James Mumford continued his strong run of form with 11th place in 38-55, while George Parr was 16th in 39-40 as Penistone filled the leading positions on the hilly course. Veteran success was again a highlight, with Ian Neville winning the men’s over60 category in 44-16. In the women’s race, Rachael Mayston finished in 4th followed closely by Josie Smith in 5th, while Lesley Parker was awarded the first ladies over50 prize following a strong run in 48-44. Barbara Haigh claimed first place in the ladies over70 category, while solid performances throughout the field came from Jill Scrivens, Mandy Mallinder, Susan Charlesworth, Jane Cockerton, Tracy Woodward and Stu Smith as Penistone fielded one of the largest contingents on the day.

There was further representative success at championship level, where Penistone runner Graihagh Turner continued her impressive winter season at the Northern Cross Country Championships at Pontefract Racecourse. Competing for Rotherham Harriers, Turner finished sixth in a high-quality under-17 girls’ field, helping her club to secure the team title.
