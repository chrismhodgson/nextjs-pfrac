summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The club was well represented at the Sheffield 10K, where Flynn Rogers led the club home in an excellent 36-18. He was backed up by strong runs from Alex Best, Michael Nicholson and a host of other finishers, with Stefan Butler-Gillen producing a course personal best by more than three minutes and John Howsham guiding a visually impaired athlete around the course.

At the Hopton 10K Jill Scrivens impressed with first place in the ladies over55 category, lowering her previous best on the course by nine minutes, supported by further category podiums for Stu Smith and Mandy Mallinder, plus Barbara Haigh and Steve Dommett also completing.

There was also a good turnout at the [Stanage Struggle](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/stanage-struggle) fell race on the edge of the Peak District, where Jon Hallam led the Penistone contingent home in 51-26, followed by Daniel Limb and Martyn Goodwin, with Harriet Drouin and Mandy Mallinder also completing strongly on the challenging course.

Away from running, Phil Hinchliffe completed the gruelling Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross for the 34th time in 4-24-59, an even more impressive achievement given that he was recovering from a nasty crash just two weeks earlier.

The club launched its winter season on Thursday night with the [opening race](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/senior-winter-handicap-2025/race-1-race-result) in the PFRAC Winter Handicap series, with Alex Crosby taking victory ahead of Jane Cockerton and Chris Baldwin. Emily Freeman was fastest lady on the night in 34-59, while James Mumford recorded the quickest overall time with 28-02. On [WMA](https://pfrac.co.uk/competitions/senior-winter-handicap) age-graded calculation, Ian Neville came out on top in 24-36 adjusted.

Penistone runners were also in action across 20 different [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-09-27) venues. Jill Scrivens took the honours as first female at Bestwood Village, Damian Kilpin claimed outright victory at Marshall Drive, and James Fryers crossed the line first at Druridge Bay, making it three first places in three weeks. Suzanne McGill was second female at Penistone, while Rob Lees was runner-up at Black Rocks and Sean Pitt third at Penistone. Michael Nicholson celebrated his 200th run at Yarborough Leisure Centre.
