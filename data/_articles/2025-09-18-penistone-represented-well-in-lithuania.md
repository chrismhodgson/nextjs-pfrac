summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
A group of Penistone runners travelled over to Vilnius to compete in parkrun, 5k, 10k, half-marathon and marathon events in the Lithuanian capital.  At Vingis parkrun, Jackie Howsham did her 300th event, whilst Jill Scrivens took the FV55 record with a time of 23:08. Julia Johnson was first back for Penistone in 22:41.

Most members competed in the 5k, 10k, and half-marathon events, whilst John Howsham completed the marathon in 4:40:17.

At the Junior Home International Fell Championships in Wales, Graihagh Turner represented England and finished 9th in the U20 category - her first time competing in this age bracket for the championships. 

Nichola McNally took on the Langdale marathon at the weekend, finishing as second lady in 3:45:55. Dubbed 'the hardest marathon in the UK' with over 1000 metres of ascent, an industrious effort was enough to see her finish ninth overall.

Also putting in the miles was Mark Crossley, who completed the Edale Mountain Rescue Team [Nine Edges Endurance](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/nine-edges-endurance) fell race in four hours and 16 minutes. Starting at Fairholmes reservoir, the route covers 20 miles over the nine edges of Derwent, Stanage, Burbage North, Burbage South, Froggatt, Curbar, Baslow, Gardoms and Birchen.

The 2025 [Trunce](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/trunce-9) series was wrapped up with the final race of the year. Traditionally completed in fancy dress, there was a strong Penistone turnout and several prize winners. George Parr won the race in 27:58, whilst Hannah Shaw was 6th lady overall and first female back for the club (39:33). In the overall season results, Richard Cottam won the series with 3 race wins and several podium finishes over the series. Other category winners were Jon Hallam (M40), Ian Neville (M50), Hannah Shaw (F), Jill Scrivens (F50), Susie Braddock (F60), Barbara Haigh (F70).
