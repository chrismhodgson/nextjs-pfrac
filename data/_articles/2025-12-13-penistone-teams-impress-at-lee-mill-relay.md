The club enjoyed a busy and successful weekend across road, fell and parkrun events with strong team performances, podium places and several significant milestones. At the [Lee Mill Fell Relay](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/lee-mill-relay) at Rossendale, Lancashire, Penistone fielded four teams on the challenging moorland course. The Penistone Men produced the standout performance of the day, finishing ninth overall with excellent runs from George Parr, Richard Cottam, Damian Kilpin and Simon Pike. There were strong mixed-team performances too, with Penistone Mixed 1 placing fifth mixed team home thanks to consistent efforts from Lesley Parker, Steve Sanders, Emily Freeman and Chris Hodgson, while Penistone Mixed 2 finished eleventh mixed team with determined runs from Jill Scrivens, Emma Stead, Becky Timms and Steve Stead. The Penistone Men’s over50 team also performed superbly, securing third place in their category through solid contributions from Steve Storey, Shaun Swallow, Ian Neville and Paul Fryers. Conditions were heavy underfoot but spirits remained high throughout. 

Three runners took part in the [Baslow Bolt](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/baslow-bolt), a popular multi-terrain race through the fields and woodland of Derbyshire.
