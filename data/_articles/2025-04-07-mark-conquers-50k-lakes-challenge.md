On Wednesday the first of the four five mile South Yorkshire Road League races kicked off in Elsecar.  There was a good turnout from Penistone with over thirty runners taking part.  First back was James Mumford in a time of 29-38.  First lady back was Suzanne McGill in 34-11.  There were age group top three finishes for Ray Brown (first over80 man), Barbara Haigh (first over75 lady), Keith Gordon (first over70 man), Julia Johnson (first over60 lady), Suzanne McGill (first over45 lady), Jonathan Bentley (first over55 man), James Mumford (third over40 man), Martin Ball (third over50 man) and Lois Lopez (third over50 lady).
