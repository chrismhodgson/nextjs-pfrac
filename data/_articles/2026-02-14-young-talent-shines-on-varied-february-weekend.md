Club runners were active across cross country, road and off-road disciplines over the weekend, with strong performances ranging from schools competition to senior racing. The highlight of the weekend came on the cross-country circuit, where two of the club’s young athletes earned county selection. Representing Barnsley Schools at the South Yorkshire Schools Cross Country Championships, Flynn Rogers produced a superb run to finish sixth overall against strong county opposition, securing qualification to represent South Yorkshire at the English Schools Cross Country Championships in Liverpool. Flynn’s performance followed recent strong outings on the roads at the Meltham and Dewsbury 10Ks and marks another major milestone in his development. There was further success at the same championships for Graihagh Turner, who finished second overall in her race to also earn selection to represent South Yorkshire at the English Schools Cross Country Championships. The pair’s performances underline the strength of Penistone’s emerging junior talent on the regional stage.

On the roads, Nichola McNally enjoyed another strong outing at the North Lakes Half Marathon. Tackling the undulating course, she finished in 1-32-46 to place 37th overall and third woman home, while also taking a clear win in the women’s over50 category. Nichola was pleased with the performance on a testing route, continuing her consistent early-season form and giving her a second [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) in as many weeks.

Away from the main races, several Penistone runners took part in off-road events. Paul and Helen Fryers competed in the [South Yorkshire Orienteers' Saturday Series](https://www.southyorkshireorienteers.org.uk/event/liveresults.php?event=2026-02-07-norfolk-park) at Norfolk Park, tackling the green course in wet winter conditions, while Ben Thorogood completed the light green course and Flynn Rogers the tough blue course at the same venue.

Harriet Drouin took on the notoriously tough Wadsworth Trog, battling through deep boggy ground before being timed out late on the course after an otherwise strong effort over the rugged Calder Valley terrain. Olivia Bagley was also in action at the Delamere Forest Canicross 5K, running alongside her dog on a tough and hilly course to finish second woman in 19-06.

Saturday’s [parkruns](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2026/2026-02-07) once again rounded off the weekend, with 52 Penistone seniors taking part across 20 venues. The standout result came at Silksworth Parkrun, where James Fryers claimed first place overall in 17-37, a performance made extra special as it marked his 350th parkrun. There were second gender places for Dawn Broom at Selby Parkrun, where she ran a personal best 22-42, and for Nicky Spinks at Girvan Prom in 25-27. Oliver France continued his strong form with third place overall at Princes Parkrun in Liverpool, finishing in 18-23. At Barnsley Parkrun, Richard Heppenstall ran a personal best 18-37 to finish sixth overall and first in his category, with Richard Cottam close behind in 18-33. Ian Neville (21-27), Shaun Swallow (23-04) and Lisa Hinchliffe (27-34) all featured strongly, while further down the field personal bests were recorded by Michael Walsh and Sara Wolstenholme. The top age-graded performances of the weekend came from Dawn Broom (85.46%), Dawn Godley (85.27%), Richard Heppenstall (80.48%), Richard Cottam (75.29%) and Ian Neville (74.75%).
