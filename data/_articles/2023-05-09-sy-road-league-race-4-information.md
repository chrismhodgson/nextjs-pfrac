The race will start at **19:00 on Wednesday 14 May** on [Horn Lane](https://goo.gl/maps/fDt7bfFjFdgyYLgp8) close to Ingbirchworth Reservoir. Race HQ and the venue for the presentation after the race will be the [Fountain](https://goo.gl/maps/9BtNRd54mhUPPdEk9) pub on Wellthorne Lane, Ingbirchworth.  The race route is [here](https://pfrac.co.uk/static/images/maps/syrl-2024-race-4.jpg).

**Parking** is **NOT** available at Yummy Yorkshire this year. Competitors and supporters are asked to park on the roads and side roads of Ingbirchworth, but not on the course, especially not on the dam wall and road leading to the race finish. Further parking is available on the left hand side. Any overflow parking will be on the left hand side of Falledge Lane, which is the road to Upper Denby from Ingbirchworth off the main A629.

**Toilets and baggage**: please do not use the roads or paths around the residential parts of Ingbirchworth. A portable toilet will be located near the finish, which most runners will pass through on the way to the start. There will be 2 portable toilets located in the holding area before the start (see below). We can also use the toilets at the Fountain but please be mindful of diners using the pub and show them respect.  A baggage area with a marshal will be available in the cabins next to the entrance to the Fountain.

** The race start** will be on Horn Lane which is on the opposite side of Ingbirchworth Reservoir and about a mile from the Fountain, so please allow plenty of time to get to the start. There will be a holding area for the runners prior to the start, on a track at the [junction of Annat Royd Lane and Horn Lane](https://goo.gl/maps/mCXcB61GqSGEd3m67). It can be reached by going across the dam wall from the Fountain and following the road to the right (0.8 miles). From there the runners will be led the 400 yards on the road to the start.

**The course** is left handed (anticlockwise). You will be directed at each junction (1 to 10 on [map](https://pfrac.co.uk/static/images/maps/syrl-2023-race-4.jpg)) by marshals. A lead car will direct the frontrunners. Please keep to the left unless instructed by marshals at the 2 right turns on the course. The course is a steady climb for the first 1.2 miles. After turning left onto Whitley Road the course is fairly flat on the top ridge: enjoy the views! It starts to go downhill after the dog leg as you approach the windmills on your left. At the end of Whitley Road you turn left up a short sharp hill at Royd Moor Hill between marshal points 5 and 6.  At 6 you turn left back onto Spicer House Lane going downhill. There's a slight rise before turning right onto Annat Royd Lane: a marshal will indicate where to get over to the right at this point in preparation for turning right down Annat Royd Lane. The last 1.2 miles is all downhill or flat back along the reservoir back towards the Fountain. The finish is just beyond where the dam wall finishes. 

**Presentation and Après Race**

Please join us at the [Fountain](https://goo.gl/maps/9BtNRd54mhUPPdEk9) for the presentation of prizes for the race series. Anyone wanting food at the Fountain should book in advance. 

Please show the residents of Ingbirchworth and other users of the Fountain respect by parking with consideration and leaving the facilities as we found them.
