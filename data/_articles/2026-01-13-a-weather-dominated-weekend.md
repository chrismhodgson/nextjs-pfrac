In the winter edition of the Round Sheffield Run, run over a multi terrain course of a little over 12 miles, there were excellent runs from Flynn Rogers (43rd in 89:21), Alex Best (71st in 94:01) and Michael Nicholson (644th in 125:58). This year's race took place in challenging conditions, with plenty of snow, ice and mud to overcome.

On Sunday, the [Trigger](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/trigger) fell race, traversing a hilly route of around 24 miles from Marsden, over Black Hill, Bleaklow and Kinder to Edale, went ahead on Sunday in the most challenging conditions in its history - ice, deep snow and an extreme headwind making for very difficult progress with ex-Penistone runner, now racing for Dark Peak Fell Runners, Phil Montgomery winning in around 5:15, around 2 hours longer than the usual leading times. Brothers James and Tom Fryers finished 48th and 49th respectively in just under 6:20. Daniel Limb and Simon Pike finished 103rd and 104th in just over 8 hours.

The final results of the South Yorkshire Cross Country League confirmed promotion from Division 2 to 1 for the senior team. There were first place category series wins for Keith Gordon (MV75) and Nichola McNally (LV55). Both runners also won gold in the South Yorkshire Championship Race. Ian Neville (MV55) was second in the league and won bronze in the championship.

Peter Beever travelled across the Pennines to run in the Central Lancs New Year Half Marathon, finishing in a time of 1:55:39.

The weather put paid to many [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2026/2026-01-10) events. However ten club members made it over to Wakefield Thornes, to run on a B course. Jade Crosby finished first female in a time of 21:52. Oliver France made the podium of Princes parkrun in Liverpool, finishing 3rd overall in 18:22. Charlotte Metcalfe was also 3rd female, at the Bedok Reservoir parkrun in Singapore.
