Thursday evening saw a fantastic showing from the club at the [Thurlstone Chase](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/thurlstone-chase), a 4.2-mile fell race with over 500 feet of climbing and a fast finish. The club turned out [46 runners](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/thurlstone-chase) and came away with an impressive haul of podium finishes and category wins.  The women led the charge, with Suzanne McGill storming to second female overall in 30-26, while Rachael Mayston followed closely to claim third female overall in 30-58.  Adding to the club’s honours, Barbara Haigh was first over70 in 48-04. The men were also impressive. James Mumford led the club home with a fifth-place overall finish and took first in the men's over40 age category in 27-06. Ian Neville claimed top honours in the men's over60 category with 29-59, and Stuart Woodhead continued his consistent form to win the over70 category in 38-46. Excellent performances also from George Parr (6th, 27-09), Dan Rushforth (11th, 27-30) and Lee Storey (29-00).

On Friday evening, Gareth Irvine produced a season’s best performance at the fast and flat DonFaster 5K, clocking 19-19 (chip time) to finish 55th overall and continue his strong summer form. His result also placed him among the top finishers in the MV40 category, underlining steady improvement through the season.

Six intrepid Penistone runners took on the Saunders Lakeland Mountain Marathon this past weekend—an iconic two-day event held in the Lake District, where competitors must carry all their gear, including tents and cooking equipment, as they navigate mountainous terrain between overnight camps.  Despite wet and challenging conditions, spirits remained high as club members tackled different courses. On the [Fairfield](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/saunders-lakeland-mountain-marathon-fairfield) course, Tom Fryers and James Fryers finished an impressive 8th overall, while Steve Sanders and Damian Kilpin placed 25th on the same route. On the [Carrock Fell](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/saunders-lakeland-mountain-marathon-carrock-fell) course, Jon Hallam turned in a strong performance to finish 30th, and Sarah Jones-Morris completed the [Harter Fell](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2025/saunders-lakeland-mountain-marathon-harter-fell) course, placing 76th overall.

It was another standout weekend for the Penistone ladies across [parkrun](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-07-05) venues near and far.
