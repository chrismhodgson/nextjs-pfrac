It’s been a packed week of racing for the club, with members taking on events across the UK and beyond. From Manchester to Snowdonia, Shrewsbury to Riga, Chester to Dearne Valley and Eyam, the club picked up PBs, age group wins, milestones and strong finishes across all terrains.

A strong Penistone turnout at the Great Manchester Run saw fast times and new PBs.

Sisters Lucy and Olivia Clough competed in the Scunthorpe 10k and were rewarded with PBs.  Lucy was first back in 50-14 followed by Olivia in 55-39. It was a solo outing for Penistone at the Chester Half as Loida Lopez flew the flag with a fantastic run. She clocked a PB of 1-47, finishing 10th out of 202 in the ladies over50 age category.

At the same running festival Damien Briscoe battled round to finish the UTS 50k in just over 11 hours.  Graihagh Turner finished the FRA Junior Championships in Sedbergh, showing resilience despite sustaining a foot injury during the race.

The final race in this year’s South Yorkshire Road League took place at a warm and blustery Ingbirchworth, hosted by Penistone. A strong local turnout made the most of home advantage on the scenic, undulating course.  James Mumford led the club home once again, securing 18th overall and rounding off a consistent series that saw him finish 3rd over40 man across the league. George Parr (24th) and Alan Nutton (31st) backed up a strong men’s team performance.  Suzanne McGill took first over45 lady, continuing her excellent run of form, while Loida Lopez and Barbara Haigh added second over50 and first over75 respectively to a successful night for the women’s team. There were solid runs from across the club, many of whom have competed in all four fixtures.  

The final league tables are now out for the South Yorkshire Road League and Penistone’s ladies put in a fantastic shift across the four-race series, securing podiums, category wins and personal bests all around. Suzanne McGill was crowned ladies over45 league champion, taking first place overall in her category with a perfect score across the four races. Lois Lopez took a brilliant second place in the ladies over50 category, rounding off a great series with another consistent run at Ingbirchworth. Barbara Haigh topped the ladies over75 age category.  Hannah Shaw and Jade Crosby both had solid performances across the competitive senior ladies category. Jill Scrivens finished 4th in a competitive ladies over50 field. Penistone’s men delivered an impressive campaign across the South Yorkshire Road League series, with strong showings across multiple age groups. James Mumford led the way with a consistent run of top performances, securing 3rd place overall in the men’s over40 age category and a strong finish among the senior men too. Sean Pitt placed 15th overall in the senior standings, while Oliver France and Ashley Howlett also featured in the top 30.
