Junior international Graihagh Turner continued her excellent form with a superb second place at the English Schools Fell Championships, representing Penistone Grammar School in the senior girls’ category for years 12 and 13. Her strong performance confirmed her status among the country’s leading young fell athletes. 

Closer to home, Alan Nutton led the club charge at the Run for Wildlife 5K held at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, finishing fifth overall in 18-53 and taking the win in the men’s over40 category. Gemma Nutton ran strongly for 22nd female in 24-39 and fifth in her age group, while Andrew Taylor clocked 29-32 for fourth in the men’s over55 and Tracy Woodward completed the course in 31-59 for eighth in the ladies over55. Meanwhile, Gareth Irvine tackled the DonFaster 5K in Doncaster amid Storm Amy conditions. Returning from illness, he described it as “not my best run” but still produced a solid effort to finish 66th, appropriately wearing bib number 66, in a chip time of 20-13.

Further south, Stefan Butler-Gillen completed the Oysho Cardiff Half Marathon, part of the SuperHalfs series, running for the Alzheimer’s Society and finishing in 2-01-59, his third-fastest half marathon to date. The Rotherham 10K also saw a strong Penistone turnout, led by Michael Nicholson in 46-21, followed by Pete Beever (47-17), Keith Gordon (56-35), Stu Smith (57-22) and Steve Dommett (1-15-32). 

Penistone athletes were also active across 11 [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-10-04) venues, with 41 seniors taking part. Dawn Broom finished second female at Concord, while Rob Lees placed third overall at Sewerby. The top five Penistone age-graded performances came from Ian Neville (78.47%), Sue Braddock (77.19%), Dawn Broom (76.48%), Rob Lees (74.96%) and Jill Scrivens (73.98%). At Barnsley, Ashley Firth ran 20-12 for sixth overall and second senior man, with Ian Neville (20-26) topping the men’s over60. Simon Pike (22-02), Shaun Swallow (24-04), Martyn Goodwin (26-40), Lisa Hinchliffe (26-42), Kelvin Bowskill (30-13) and Ray Brown (36-29) also recorded category wins. Jill Scrivens continued her good form with 24-09 at Gedling to take first lady over55, while Sue Braddock (25-08) topped the same category at Cinder Track.
