Penistone Footpath Runners & Athletics Club is a thriving club based in the market town of Penistone, on the edge of the Peak District in South Yorkshire. For a history of the club see the link on the left.
We cater for all sorts of runners:
- Beginners &ndash; people wanting to get fit and improve their mental and physical health
- Juniors &ndash; from the age of 8 to 17
- Adults of all ages and abilities
We meet formally twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, but there are lots of informal and ad hoc meetings throughout the week, organised through social network groups.
For those that want to compete, we are affiliated to [England Athletics](https://www.englandathletics.org/clubs-and-facilities/) and the [Fell Runners Association](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/) and members can enter all types of events, from local races to national championships:
- Road
