Penistone Footpath Runners & Athletics Club is a thriving club based in the market town of Penistone, on the edge of the Peak District in South Yorkshire. The links on the left provide more information - club policies can be found via [Links](https://pfrac.co.uk/about/links). 
We cater for all sorts of runners:

* Beginners &ndash; people wanting to get fit and improve their mental and physical health
* Juniors &ndash; from the age of 12 to 17

  We meet formally twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, but there are lots of informal and ad hoc meetings throughout the week, organised through social network groups.
  For those that want to compete, we are affiliated to [England Athletics](https://www.englandathletics.org/clubs-and-facilities/) and the [Fell Runners Association](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/) and members can enter all types of events, from local races to national championships:
