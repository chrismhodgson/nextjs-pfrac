The cross country season runs over the autumn/winter, and many club members, juniors and seniors, take part in the [South Yorkshire Cross Country League](https://www.sycaa.org.uk/cross-country/) each year (normally four races between September and December). The club often organises one of the races using the Penistone Showground.

Anyone who is interested can also enter the [Yorkshire](https://www.northernathletics.co.uk/news/yorkshire-news-page/) and [English](https://www.englishcrosscountry.co.uk/) cross country championships.

Results are all available on the British Athletics [Power of 10](https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/athleteslookup.aspx) service.
