The club has a very popular junior section, taking boys and girls from the age of 8 to 17. England Athletics rules are very strict about the qualifications needed to lead groups of juniors, and the club is very short of Athletics Coaches who are qualified to take children under 12, so for this age group there is a waiting list. Contact [Bob Innes](mailto:jane&bob@btinternet.com), Junior Secretary, if your son or daughter is interested in joining the club.

For most juniors, the club is something they attend every Tuesday evening, all year round (with breaks for school holidays) where they get some exercise with friends. Sessions are structured to maintain interest and safety, catering for a wide range of ability. Those that want to push themselves to get fitter have the opportunity to train with seniors, under the supervision of appropriately qualified coaches.

All the coaches and coaching assistants have up-to-date [DBS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service) checks, as required by England Athletics.

### Competing

All juniors are encouraged to join in organised events, including the local track and field league, indoor athletics league, cross country league and off-road races. In particular, the [Junior Trunce](http://www.trunce.org/) is very popular, taking place at the same time as the senior race in Oxspring, 9 times a year.

### The Winter Handicap League

The club organises a winter league based on a series of handicap races for all the juniors in the club, and other ad hoc races in the summer.

### Awards

Prizes are given out at the annual presentation evening.

- Trophies for the top three in the Winter Handicap League (LINK NEEDED) and certificates for all participants
- The Winter League trophies, unhelpfully named but awarded for general performance in internal and external competitions
- The Track and Field trophies, awarded to the juniors (under 11 and under 17) who showed the largest improvements across all track and field events
- The Coaches' Award, awarded for attitude to training and effort.

Past winners of all the trophies are here (LINK NEEDED).
