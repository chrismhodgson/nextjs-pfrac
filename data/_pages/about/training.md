The main club session for seniors and [juniors](https://pfrac.co.uk/about/juniors) is at 6:30pm on Tuesday at [Penistone Church Football Club](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Penistone+Church+Football+Club/@53.523332,-1.625649,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48797d6f378b73f1:0x3ae39c5f7e6bf5ba?hl=en-GB). There is a small informal meeting on Thursday nights at the same time and place (senior members only), and other informal groups meet in different places each week for training or social runs, off and on road.

All formal sessions are led by coaches and/or run leaders appropriately qualified in line with England Athletics rules. Sessions range from tough speed and hill sessions to longer and shorter, faster and slower runs. New members are always welcome to come and try the club out before joining, and can be catered for in one of the training groups.

Each week details of the Tuesday sessions on offer are e-mailed out to all members.

See the sections on [Road Running](https://pfrac.co.uk/about/road-running) and [Fell and Trail Running](https://pfrac.co.uk/about/fell-running) for more details of the types of running available.
