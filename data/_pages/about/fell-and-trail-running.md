Off-road running is a big part of the club, with options on Tuesdays and Thursdays from the club and active informal groups on other days. The club's name has its origin in the wish to exploit the vast network of local public footpaths and bridleways, and we keep that tradition going. We are also close to the [Peak District](https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/home) and can easily exploit the open access and wonderful scenery it provides. Many members compete in [fell races](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/races) and members of the club organise several local fell and trail races:

- [Hartcliff Hill Race](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/hartcliff-hill-race), [Oughtibridge Chase](https://www.oughtibridgegala.org/the-tom-holmes-gala-chase), [Amble's Revenge](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/oxspring-hunshelf-amble), [Penistone Hill Race](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/penistone-hill-race), [The Trunce](http://www.trunce.org/2022-race-dates/), [Thurlstone Chase](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/thurlstone-chase)
- We enter fell relays, such as the [British Athletics Fell and Hill Relay Championships](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/championships/british-championships#relay), the [Hodgson Brothers Mountain Relay](https://hbmr.org.uk/)
- There is a Fell section to the [Club Championship](https://pfrac.co.uk/competitions/club-championship), with local races selected each year across a range of distances
- We have a [Fell League](https://pfrac.co.uk/competitions/fell-league) in which members accumulate points from all the fell races they compete in during the year, and prizes are awarded overall and in each age group

### English Champions

Many members, junior and senior, compete at all different levels, mostly there to take part, enjoying pushing themselves and/or the sociable nature of fell racing, but we have had a few very successful runners, three of whom have been English Fell Champions:

- 1986: Dave Cartwright (MV40)
- 2012: Barbara Haigh (FV65)
- 2021: Julie Darigala (FV45 and FV50)


### Bob Graham Round

T﻿he [Bob Graham Round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Graham_Round) is an individual fell running challenge in the Lake District. It is named after Bob Graham (1889–1966), who ran a circuit, starting and finishing at the Moot Hall in Keswick, summiting 42 fells, within 24 hours.  The route is approximately 66 miles (106 km) with 27,000 feet (8,200 m) of ascent and consists of five legs - the legs are defined by the four road crossings.

In order to be officially recognised by the [Bob Graham Club](http://bobgrahamclub.org.uk/), runners must be accompanied to each summit, and the challenge normally involves a team effort with supporters running on each leg, carrying kit and assisting with navigation and moral support.

S﻿ixteen club members have completed the challenge within 24 hours and become members of the Bob Graham Club.
