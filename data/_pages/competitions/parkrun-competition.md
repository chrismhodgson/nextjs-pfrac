The Parkrun Competition ran from 2017 to 2022.  From 2023 there is no competition, but a summary of each week's performances, and some statistics for the year for Penistone runners, are kept up to date on the [results website](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/latest). All the columns on the summary pages are sortable, so you can sort by fastest time, best age grade, most parkruns etc by clicking on the column headings.
