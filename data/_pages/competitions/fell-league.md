### The 2022 Fell League

Following interruptions through 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, the 2022 Fell League is back to the original format, ie including all FRA-licenced fell races.

All first claim members' results in all FRA registered senior races count towards the Fell League &ndash; you get points for every race, without any limit, and you get more points the faster you run.

All FRA registered senior races count, which includes all 9 Trunces, Hartcliff Hill and Thurlstone Chase, as well as all the Club Championship Fell Section races, English Championships, etc.

Tables will be published here and updated at least every month, but the onus is on the runner to tell me ([paul.fryers@gmail.com](mailto:paul.fryers@gmail.com)) of their results: I can't check the results of every race to find PFR runners, although where there is a big turnout I don't need everyone to supply their own result. Just tell me the race you ran and your time.

### Qualifying runners

All members who are first claim Penistone for fell races will be included. Members joining (or re-joining) during the year will only have results counted from the date their subscription has been paid.

### Qualifying races

All qualifying races are listed in the [FRA fixtures calendar](http://fellrunner.org.uk/races.php) on the FRA website. Qualifying races are those registered with the FRA, which includes most of those listed in the calendar &ndash; on each race page, if the title of the race is followed by (R) it is an FRA registered race and it will count towards our championship. (Some other races are listed in the FRA calendar for information but are not FRA registered races). Senior races are those with no upper age limit: juniors running in senior races (where permitted) will be included in the League.

### Scoring

Points are awarded according to your time in relation to the fastest male/female runner on the day. If you are first man or first lady you get 100 points. If you take exactly double the time of the winner you get 50 points. For anyone who wants to know the technical details of the calculations: your time is divided by the winner's time, and the log(base 2) is taken of the resulting ratio. This is then subtracted from 2 and the result multiplied by 50 to give your points. For orienteering score format races the points are calculated by dividing your score (points net of any time penalties) by the winner's net score.  Awards are given, at the discretion of the club officials, for the overall male and female winners and the winners in each age group. If two members finish level on points (unlikely that they will, exactly), the older runner will be placed higher. In the results, age categories will be based on age on January 1st of the competition year, not age on the day of the race.
