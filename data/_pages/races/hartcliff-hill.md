Hartcliff Hill is a BS category fell race on a marked and marshalled course &ndash; no navigation or prior experience required, however all runners should familiarise themselves with the route. The terrain is a mixture of fields and rough tracks, with three short sections of asphalt road.

The race starts and finishes in Penistone, on the playing fields next to the [Bowling Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/naJ6HVefAArV7hf99). The race previously started near Langsett reservoir, but in recent years it has been difficult to organise because of parking permissions.

#### Entry

Pre-entry will be available closer to the time.

Minimum age to enter is 17 on the 31 December 2026 (FRA rules).

<!---

Entry on the day will be available for Â£8 if entry limit of 200 not reached.
