The Amble's Revenge is a trail race based on the former Hunshelf Amble. Whereas the former race started and finished in Green Moor, taking in Oxspring en route, the 7¾ mile, undulating, mainly off-road race now starts and finishes in Oxspring, passing through Green Moor. It takes place around Christmas or New Year.

Between 2014 and 2019 the "Oxspring Hunshelf Amble" was run in the early Summer, following a similar route but run the opposite way round to the Revenge.

The race has chip timing, and there is a gift for all entrants.

#### Entry

Online entry will be available nearer the time.

Pre-entry fees: £12 for EA registered runners and £14 for non-EA registered. Entries on the day if the race limit of 350 is not reached for an additional £2.  Please note this race has sold out well before the date in recent years.

The race is run under UK Athletics rules of competition ([Trail Running Association](https://www.tra-uk.org/organisers) permit no 6820). Minimum age to enter is 17 on the day of the race.

#### Registration

Registration and number collection from 09:00 at Rafters Bar, adjoined to the Waggon & Horses, Oxspring, S36 8YQ.
